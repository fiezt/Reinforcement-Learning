# Reinforcement-Learning

# Overview
This repository contains my ongoing implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms. At present, the algorithms are fully compatible to be run with  environments from OpenAI Gym that have discrete state and action spaces, and a Grid World environment I created to test algorithms with. In addition to this, I have also created a testbed for multi-arm bandit problems to allow for comparison of regret between algorithms.
